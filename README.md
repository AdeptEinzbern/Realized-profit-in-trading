Realized Profit in Trading

This project is a Python script that calculates the realized profit for a set of trades in the stock market. It takes in a CSV file with the details of the trades and outputs the total realized profit.
Getting Started

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website here.

Once you have Python installed, you can download the script from this GitHub repository. Simply clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to a directory on your computer.
Usage

To use the script, you'll need to provide it with a CSV file containing the details of the trades. The file should have the following columns:

    Symbol: The ticker symbol for the stock being traded.
    Quantity: The number of shares traded.
    Price: The price per share at the time of the trade.
    Buy/Sell: Whether the trade was a buy or sell.

Here's an example of what the CSV file should look like:

Symbol,Quantity,Price,Buy/Sell
AAPL,10,150.00,Buy
AAPL,5,160.00,Buy
AAPL,8,170.00,Sell
AAPL,3,180.00,Sell


Once you have your CSV file, you can run the script by navigating to the directory where it's located and running the following command:

php

python realized_profit.py <filename.csv>


Replace <filename.csv> with the name of your CSV file.

The script will output the total realized profit for your trades.
